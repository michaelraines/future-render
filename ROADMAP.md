**Exit criteria**: `cmd/clear/main.go` opens a window, shows a solid color,
responds to Escape key.

## Milestone 2 — Image Rendering (Done)

Goal: draw an image to the screen with transforms. This validates the full
Image → Batcher → Pipeline → GPU path end to end.

### Phase 2a — GPU texture lifecycle ✓

Wire `Image` to an actual GPU texture so that pixel data can be uploaded
and drawn.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Add backend texture handle to `Image` | Done | `texture backend.Texture` + `textureID uint32` |
| `Image` creates GPU texture on construction via device | Done | `NewImage`, `NewImageFromImage` |

### Phase 2c — DrawImage → Batcher → GPU ✓

Connect `Image.DrawImage()` through the batcher to actual draw calls.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Image.DrawImage()` builds quad vertices from GeoM | Done | 4 verts, 6 indices per sprite |
| `Image.DrawImage()` submits `DrawCommand` to batcher | Done | TextureID, ShaderID, BlendMode, Depth |

| Sprite render pass: flush batcher → upload VBO/IBO → draw | Done | `pipeline.SpritePass` |
| Engine loop: collect draws → flush batcher → execute passes → swap | Done | `engine_glfw.go` render loop |

### Phase 2d — DrawImageOptions + SubImage ✓

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DrawImageOptions` — ColorScale applied to vertex color | Done | Zero-value defaults to white |
| `DrawImageOptions` — BlendMode mapped to backend blend | Done | `blendToBackend()` |
| `DrawImageOptions` — Filter sets texture sampling | Done | GL sampler objects, per-draw filter via `SetTextureFilter` |

## Milestone 3 — DrawTriangles + Custom Geometry (Done)

Goal: expose the low-level `DrawTriangles` API for custom vertex data.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Image.DrawTriangles()` wired end-to-end | Done | Vertex + index data → batcher → SpritePass → GPU |
| FillRule support (NonZero, EvenOdd) | Done | Two-pass stencil: INVERT + NOTEQUAL for EvenOdd |
| `DrawTrianglesOptions` — Blend, Filter, FillRule | Done | All three wired through batcher |
| Example: procedural mesh / starfield | Done | `cmd/triangles/main.go` — overlapping triangles demo |

**Exit criteria**: `DrawTriangles` renders custom shapes with correct winding
and blending.

**Completed**: DrawTriangles with full Blend/Filter/FillRule support. EvenOdd
uses GL stencil objects (two-pass: INVERT to mark odd-overlap pixels, then
NOTEQUAL 0 to draw). Added SetStencil/SetColorWrite to CommandEncoder.
Pipeline test coverage at 98.4%.

---

## Milestone 4 — Input (Done)

Goal: full keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepad input parity with Ebitengine.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Wire GLFW key callbacks → `internal/input` State | Done | Already wired in M1 via `installCallbacks` |
| Wire mouse button/move/scroll callbacks | Done | Already wired in M1; fixed cursor DX/DY delta computation |
| `IsKeyPressed` connected to real state | Done | Public API delegates to `inputState` via key mapping table |

**Exit criteria**: all public input functions return real platform state.

**Completed**: Public API fully wired to `internal/input.State`. Key mapping
table handles differing iota orderings between public and platform key
constants. GLFW cursor position callback now computes DX/DY deltas. Expanded
key set to cover full keyboard. Added `IsKeyJustPressed`/`IsKeyJustReleased`
to public API. 100% test coverage on `internal/input`, 99.4% on root package.

| Multi-line layout / word wrapping | Deferred | Caller splits lines manually |
| Text alignment (center, right) | Deferred | Future enhancement |
| Complex scripts (BiDi, ligatures) | Deferred | Needs `go-text/typesetting` |
| `cmd/text/main.go` example | Deferred | Needs GLFW build environment |
| `cmd/input/main.go` example | Deferred | Needs GLFW build environment |

**Exit criteria**: render arbitrary Unicode text from TTF fonts at any size.

**Completed**: Full `text/` package with `Face`, glyph cache, row-packed
RGBA8 atlas, and `Draw()` function. Glyphs flow through existing
`DrawImage` → `Batcher` → `SpritePass` pipeline with zero internal changes.
All glyphs from the same face auto-merge into 1-2 GPU draw calls via shared
atlas texture. Added `Image.WritePixels()` for incremental atlas uploads.

## Milestone 6 — Audio (Done)

Goal: audio playback parity with Ebitengine's `audio` package.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Audio context + player abstraction | Done | `audio/` package, singleton Context wrapping oto/v3 |

| Multiple simultaneous players | Done | Via oto context automatic mixing |
| InfiniteLoop with intro support | Done | `NewInfiniteLoopWithIntro` for intro+loop BGM |
| Example: sound effects + BGM | Deferred | Needs GLFW build environment |

**Exit criteria**: play, pause, loop, and mix audio from WAV/OGG sources.

**Completed**: Full `audio/` package with Context (singleton, wraps oto/v3),
Player (Play/Pause/Volume/Seek/Rewind/Close), InfiniteLoop (with optional
intro section), WAV decoder (pure Go RIFF parser, 8/16-bit, mono→stereo),
and OGG Vorbis decoder (wraps jfreymuth/oggvorbis). All audio flows through
composable io.Reader pipeline: Decoder → Loop → Player → hardware. MP3
deferred pending dependency availability. Coverage: audio 84.6%, wav 86.1%,
vorbis 86.1%.

## Milestone 7 — Shader System (Done)

Goal: user-defined shaders beyond the built-in sprite shader.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Shader` public type wrapping backend shader | Done | `NewShader` (Kage) + `NewShaderFromGLSL` |
| Kage-to-GLSL transpiler | Done | `internal/shaderir/`, uses `go/parser` + `go/ast` |

**Exit criteria**: users can write and apply custom Kage or GLSL shaders to draw calls.

**Completed**: Full shader system with dual entry points: `NewShader(kageSource)`
for Ebitengine-compatible Kage shaders and `NewShaderFromGLSL(vert, frag)` for
raw GLSL. Kage transpiler parses Go-syntax shader source via `go/parser`,
extracts uniforms and Fragment function, emits GLSL 330 core with image helper
functions (imageSrc0-3At, bounds checking, origin/size). SpritePass supports
per-batch shader switching via ShaderResolver. Uniforms can be set via direct
methods or Ebitengine-compatible `map[string]any`. Coverage: shaderir 83.8%,
root package 97.2%, pipeline 85.3%.

**Exit criteria**: all Ebitengine 2D examples can be ported with minimal
changes (import path swap + minor API adjustments).

**Completed**: Off-screen render targets via `backend.RenderTarget` with per-
image FBOs created alongside textures. Batcher sorts by TargetID first, then
sprite pass iterates render target groups with BeginRenderPass/EndRenderPass
per target. ReadPixels via `glGetTexImage` in OpenGL backend. ColorM wired to
fragment shader via `uColorBody` (mat4) and `uColorTranslation` (vec4) uniforms
set per-batch. SetScreenClearedEveryFrame as atomic bool. FUTURE_RENDER_BACKEND
env var for backend selection. Coverage: root 97.4%, pipeline 90.6%, batch 97.5%.

| Frustum culling | Future | Math already exists |
| Instanced rendering | Future | |

## Principles

These guide every milestone:

1. **Additive, not rewrite** — new features add passes/types, never restructure
   existing working code.
2. **Tests before merge** — every milestone must pass `go test ./...` and
   `go vet ./...`.
3. **No CGo anywhere** — the entire engine is pure Go. OpenGL and GLFW are
   loaded at runtime via purego (`internal/gl/`, `internal/platform/glfw/`).
4. **Ebitengine API compatibility** — public API names and signatures match
   Ebitengine where possible, enabling straightforward migration.
5. **3D-ready from day one** — no 2D-only assumptions in internal layers. See
   FUTURE_3D.md for constraints.
6. **Manual texture management** — no automatic atlas. Users control GPU memory
   explicitly, with optional atlas utilities.

## How to Update This File

When completing a milestone task:
1. Change its status from `Planned` to `Done`
2. Add any relevant notes (caveats, deviations from plan)
3. If new tasks were discovered during implementation, add them to the
   appropriate milestone or create a new one
4. Commit the ROADMAP.md update alongside the implementation
