responds to Escape key.

Goal: draw an image to the screen with transforms. This validates the full
Image → Batcher → Pipeline → GPU path end to end.

## Milestone 6 — Audio (Done)

Goal: audio playback parity with Ebitengine's `audio` package.

| Task | Status | Notes |

intro section), WAV decoder (pure Go RIFF parser, 8/16-bit, mono→stereo),
and OGG Vorbis decoder (wraps jfreymuth/oggvorbis). All audio flows through
composable io.Reader pipeline: Decoder → Loop → Player → hardware. MP3
decoder wraps hajimehoshi/go-mp3 with the same Stream interface as WAV and
Vorbis. Coverage: audio 84.6%, wav 86.1%, vorbis 86.1%, mp3 94.5%.

## Milestone 7 — Shader System (Done)

Goal: user-defined shaders beyond the built-in sprite shader.

| Task | Status | Notes |

| Kage-to-GLSL transpiler | Done | `internal/shaderir/`, uses `go/parser` + `go/ast` |
| GLSL vertex + fragment shader compilation | Done | Via backend `Device.NewShader` |
| Uniform binding API (float, vec2/4, mat4, int) | Done | Direct methods + `map[string]any` Ebitengine-compatible |

| Shader hot-reload for development | Done | `ShaderReloader` with polling-based file watching |
| Example: custom post-processing shader | Done | `cmd/shader/main.go` — time-varying color effect |

**Exit criteria**: users can write and apply custom Kage or GLSL shaders to draw calls.

**Completed**: Full shader system with dual entry points: `NewShader(kageSource)`
for Ebitengine-compatible Kage shaders and `NewShaderFromGLSL(vert, frag)` for
raw GLSL. Kage transpiler parses Go-syntax shader source via `go/parser`,
extracts uniforms and Fragment function, emits GLSL 330 core with image helper
functions (imageSrc0-3At, bounds checking, origin/size). SpritePass supports
per-batch shader switching via ShaderResolver. Uniforms can be set via direct
methods or Ebitengine-compatible `map[string]any`. `ShaderReloader` for
development-time hot-reload: polling-based file watching (mod time), keeps
old shader on compile error. Coverage: shaderir 83.8%, root package 94.5%,
pipeline 90.6%.

## Milestone 8 — Advanced 2D Features (Done)

| Vsync toggle at runtime | Done | `SetVsyncEnabled`/`IsVsyncEnabled` already in M3 |
| `Image.Clear()` | Done | Fills with transparent black |

**Exit criteria**: all Ebitengine 2D examples can be ported with minimal
changes (import path swap + minor API adjustments).

**Completed**: Off-screen render targets via `backend.RenderTarget` with per-
image FBOs created alongside textures. Batcher sorts by TargetID first, then
sprite pass iterates render target groups with BeginRenderPass/EndRenderPass
per target. ReadPixels via `glGetTexImage` in OpenGL backend. ColorM wired to
fragment shader via `uColorBody` (mat4) and `uColorTranslation` (vec4) uniforms
set per-batch. SetScreenClearedEveryFrame as atomic bool. FUTURE_RENDER_BACKEND
env var for backend selection. `ResourceTracker` for context loss recovery:
Godot-inspired command replay records texture/shader creation parameters and
replays them against a new Device after context loss. Coverage: root 94.5%,
pipeline 90.6%, batch 97.5%.

## Milestone 9 — Multi-Backend Support (Done)

Goal: ship all planned GPU backends — WebGL2, Vulkan, Metal, WebGPU, and
DirectX 12 — alongside the existing OpenGL 3.3 backend. Every backend
implements the same `backend.Device` / `CommandEncoder` interface and must
pass a shared conformance test suite. A software rasterizer provides headless
CI coverage for backend-agnostic logic.

### 9a — Backend Conformance Infrastructure (Done)

platform-specific preference lists (macOS→Metal→Vulkan→OpenGL→Soft, etc.).
`cmd/backends` prints a capability table for all registered backends. DESIGN.md

## Milestone 10 — 3D Rendering (Future)

Goal: 3D mesh rendering, lighting, materials — as described in FUTURE_3D.md.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Scene graph (transform hierarchy) | Future | |
| Mesh type + glTF import | Future | |
| Camera (perspective, orthographic, controllers) | Future | |

| Frustum culling | Future | Math already exists |
| Instanced rendering | Future | |

---

## Principles

These guide every milestone:

1. **Additive, not rewrite** — new features add passes/types, never restructure
   existing working code.
2. **Tests before merge** — every milestone must pass `go test ./...` and
   `go vet ./...`.
3. **No CGo anywhere** — the entire engine is pure Go. OpenGL and GLFW are
   loaded at runtime via purego (`internal/gl/`, `internal/platform/glfw/`).
4. **Ebitengine API compatibility** — public API names and signatures match
   Ebitengine where possible, enabling straightforward migration.
5. **3D-ready from day one** — no 2D-only assumptions in internal layers. See
   FUTURE_3D.md for constraints.
6. **Manual texture management** — no automatic atlas. Users control GPU memory
   explicitly, with optional atlas utilities.

## How to Update This File

When completing a milestone task:
1. Change its status from `Planned` to `Done`
2. Add any relevant notes (caveats, deviations from plan)
3. If new tasks were discovered during implementation, add them to the
   appropriate milestone or create a new one
4. Commit the ROADMAP.md update alongside the implementation
