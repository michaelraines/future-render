## Milestone 1 — OpenGL Backend + Window (Done)

Goal: open a window, clear it to a color, and close on Escape. The minimal
proof that the full stack (platform → backend → pipeline → engine) connects.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GLFW window implementation (`internal/platform/glfw/`) | Done | purego (no CGo), build-tagged |
| OpenGL 3.3 device implementation (`internal/backend/opengl/`) | Done | purego (no CGo), full Device + CommandEncoder |
| Remove CGo dependencies (go-gl/gl, go-gl/glfw) | Done | Replaced with purego dynamic loading via `internal/gl/` |
| Wire engine.run() → platform window → backend device | Done | Fixed-timestep update + variable draw |
| Clear pass implementation | Done | Engine clears via CommandEncoder.BeginRenderPass |
| Present pass (logical screen → window blit) | Done | SwapBuffers via GLFW |
| Smoke test: window opens, clears blue, Escape exits | Done | `cmd/clear/main.go` |
| `go build` with `-tags glfw` compiles and links | Done | Also compiles without tags (stub engine) |
| CI lint pipeline (golangci-lint v2) | Done | 0 issues on both tagged and untagged builds |
| Makefile with `ci`, `lint`, `test`, `build` targets | Done | |
| GitHub Actions CI workflow | Done | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

**Exit criteria**: `cmd/clear/main.go` opens a window, shows a solid color,
responds to Escape key.

## Milestone 2 — Image Rendering (Planned)

Goal: draw an image to the screen with transforms. This validates the full
Image → Batcher → Pipeline → GPU path end to end.

### Phase 2a — GPU texture lifecycle

Wire `Image` to an actual GPU texture so that pixel data can be uploaded
and drawn.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Add backend texture handle to `Image` | Planned | Store `backend.Texture` + numeric ID |
| `Image` creates GPU texture on construction via device | Planned | `NewImage(w,h)` allocates RGBA8 texture |
| `Image.Dispose()` releases GPU texture | Planned | |
| Texture creation from `image.RGBA` in OpenGL backend | Planned | Already in Device, verify path |

### Phase 2b — Sprite shader + VAO setup

The default shader that all 2D sprite drawing uses.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Default sprite vertex shader (GLSL 330) | Planned | Accepts Vertex2D layout, applies ortho projection |
| Default sprite fragment shader (GLSL 330) | Planned | Textured quad × vertex color |
| VAO setup for Vertex2D layout | Planned | Position (float2), UV (float2), Color (float4) |
| Orthographic projection matrix from screen dimensions | Planned | Updated each frame from Layout() |

### Phase 2c — DrawImage → Batcher → GPU

Connect `Image.DrawImage()` through the batcher to actual draw calls.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Image.DrawImage()` builds quad vertices from GeoM | Planned | 4 verts, 6 indices per sprite |
| `Image.DrawImage()` submits `DrawCommand` to batcher | Planned | TextureID, ShaderID, BlendMode, Depth |
| `Image.Fill()` wired to clear or fullscreen quad | Planned | |
| Sprite render pass: flush batcher → upload VBO/IBO → draw | Planned | Per-frame dynamic buffers |
| Engine loop: collect draws → flush batcher → execute passes → swap | Planned | Replace current stub draw path |

### Phase 2d — DrawImageOptions + SubImage

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DrawImageOptions` — ColorScale applied to vertex color | Planned | |
| `DrawImageOptions` — BlendMode mapped to backend blend | Planned | |
| `DrawImageOptions` — Filter sets texture sampling | Planned | Nearest vs Linear |
| `Image.SubImage()` with correct UV mapping | Planned | Source rect → UV rect |

### Phase 2e — Example + validation

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PNG image loading utility (stdlib `image/png`) | Planned | Helper in root or `asset/` |
| `cmd/sprite/main.go` example | Planned | Load PNG, draw with scale + rotation |

**Exit criteria**: a PNG sprite renders on screen with scale, rotation, and
alpha blending.

---

## Milestone 3 — DrawTriangles + Custom Geometry (Planned)

Goal: expose the low-level `DrawTriangles` API for custom vertex data.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Image.DrawTriangles()` wired end-to-end | Planned | Vertex + index data → batcher |
| FillRule support (NonZero, EvenOdd) | Planned | Stencil-based |

**Exit criteria**: `DrawTriangles` renders custom shapes with correct winding
and blending.

---

## Milestone 4 — Input (Planned)

Goal: full keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepad input parity with Ebitengine.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Wire GLFW key callbacks → `internal/input` State | Planned | |
| Wire mouse button/move/scroll callbacks | Planned | |
| `IsKeyPressed`/`InputChars` connected to real state | Planned | |
| `CursorPosition`/`Wheel` connected | Planned | |
| Gamepad support via GLFW joystick API | Planned | |
| Touch support (desktop emulation + mobile) | Planned | |
| Cursor mode (visible/hidden/captured) | Planned | |
| `IsKeyJustPressed` (edge detection) | Planned | Already in internal/input |
| `cmd/input/main.go` example | Planned | Print key/mouse state |

**Exit criteria**: all public input functions return real platform state.

## Principles

These guide every milestone:

1. **Additive, not rewrite** — new features add passes/types, never restructure
   existing working code.
2. **Tests before merge** — every milestone must pass `go test ./...` and
   `go vet ./...`.
3. **No CGo anywhere** — the entire engine is pure Go. OpenGL and GLFW are
   loaded at runtime via purego (`internal/gl/`, `internal/platform/glfw/`).
4. **Ebitengine API compatibility** — public API names and signatures match
   Ebitengine where possible, enabling straightforward migration.
5. **3D-ready from day one** — no 2D-only assumptions in internal layers. See
   FUTURE_3D.md for constraints.
6. **Manual texture management** — no automatic atlas. Users control GPU memory
   explicitly, with optional atlas utilities.

## How to Update This File

When completing a milestone task:
1. Change its status from `Planned` to `Done`
2. Add any relevant notes (caveats, deviations from plan)
3. If new tasks were discovered during implementation, add them to the
   appropriate milestone or create a new one
4. Commit the ROADMAP.md update alongside the implementation
