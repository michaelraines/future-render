# Future Render — Roadmap

This document tracks incremental progress toward full Ebitengine 2D parity and
beyond. Each milestone is a shippable vertical slice — tests pass, `go vet`
clean, examples runnable. Update this file as milestones are completed.

## Legend

- **Done** — merged, tested, documented
- **In Progress** — actively being worked on
- **Planned** — scoped and ready for implementation
- **Future** — defined but not yet scoped in detail

## Milestone 1 — OpenGL Backend + Window (Planned)

Goal: open a window, clear it to a color, and close on Escape. The minimal
proof that the full stack (platform → backend → pipeline → engine) connects.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GLFW window implementation (`internal/platform/glfw/`) | Planned | go-gl/glfw v3.3, build-tagged |
| OpenGL 3.3 device implementation (`internal/backend/opengl/`) | Planned | Core profile, DSA where available |
| Wire engine.run() → platform window → backend device | Planned | Fixed-timestep + variable draw |
| Clear pass implementation | Planned | First real pipeline pass |
| Present pass (logical screen → window blit) | Planned | Respects `Layout()` scaling |
| Smoke test: window opens, clears blue, Escape exits | Planned | Manual test + CI headless |
| `go build` with `-tags glfw` compiles and links | Planned | |

**Exit criteria**: `cmd/clear/main.go` opens a window, shows a solid color,
responds to Escape key.

---

## Milestone 2 — Image Rendering (Planned)

Goal: load an image from disk, draw it to the screen with transforms. This
validates the full Image → Batcher → Pipeline → GPU path.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Texture creation from `image.RGBA` in OpenGL backend | Planned | Upload, bind, dispose |
| Default sprite shader (vertex + fragment GLSL) | Planned | Textured quad, vertex color multiply |
| Sprite pass implementation | Planned | Reads batches, issues draw calls |
| `Image.DrawImage()` wired to batcher | Planned | GeoM → vertex positions, UV from source |
| `Image.Fill()` wired to clear or fullscreen quad | Planned | |
| `Image.SubImage()` with correct UV mapping | Planned | Sprite sheet support |
| PNG/JPEG image loading utility | Planned | `asset/` package |
| `DrawImageOptions` — ColorScale, BlendMode, Filter | Planned | |
| `cmd/sprite/main.go` example | Planned | Load image, draw with rotation |

**Exit criteria**: a PNG sprite renders on screen with scale, rotation, and
alpha blending.

---

## Milestone 3 — DrawTriangles + Custom Geometry (Planned)

Goal: expose the low-level `DrawTriangles` API for custom vertex data.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Image.DrawTriangles()` wired end-to-end | Planned | Vertex + index data → batcher |
| FillRule support (NonZero, EvenOdd) | Planned | Stencil-based |
| `DrawTrianglesOptions` — Blend, Filter, FillRule | Planned | |
| Example: procedural mesh / starfield | Planned | |

**Exit criteria**: `DrawTriangles` renders custom shapes with correct winding
and blending.

---

## Milestone 4 — Input (Planned)

Goal: full keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepad input parity with Ebitengine.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Wire GLFW key callbacks → `internal/input` State | Planned | |
| Wire mouse button/move/scroll callbacks | Planned | |
| `IsKeyPressed`/`InputChars` connected to real state | Planned | |
| `CursorPosition`/`Wheel` connected | Planned | |
| Gamepad support via GLFW joystick API | Planned | |
| Touch support (desktop emulation + mobile) | Planned | |
| Cursor mode (visible/hidden/captured) | Planned | |
| `IsKeyJustPressed` (edge detection) | Planned | Already in internal/input |
| `cmd/input/main.go` example | Planned | Print key/mouse state |

**Exit criteria**: all public input functions return real platform state.

---

## Milestone 5 — Text Rendering (Planned)

Goal: render TTF/OTF text to Images, matching Ebitengine's `text/v2` package.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TTF parsing and glyph rasterization | Planned | Pure Go or freetype dep |
| Font atlas generation and caching | Planned | `text/` package |
| `text.Draw()` API | Planned | Position, size, color, alignment |
| Unicode + line wrapping support | Planned | |
| Font face management (size, style) | Planned | |
| Example: FPS counter overlay | Planned | |

**Exit criteria**: render arbitrary Unicode text from TTF fonts at any size.

---

## Milestone 6 — Audio (Planned)

Goal: audio playback parity with Ebitengine's `audio` package.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Audio context + player abstraction | Planned | `audio/` package |
| WAV decoding | Planned | |
| OGG Vorbis decoding | Planned | Pure Go |
| MP3 decoding | Planned | Pure Go |
| Streaming playback (large files) | Planned | |
| Volume, pause, seek, loop | Planned | |
| Multiple simultaneous players | Planned | |
| Example: sound effects + BGM | Planned | |

**Exit criteria**: play, pause, loop, and mix audio from WAV/OGG/MP3 sources.

## Milestone 7 — Shader System (Planned)

Goal: user-defined shaders beyond the built-in sprite shader.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Shader` public type wrapping backend shader | Planned | |

| Uniform binding API (float, vec2/4, mat4, texture) | Planned | |
| `Image.DrawRectShader()` equivalent | Planned | |
| Shader hot-reload for development | Planned | Optional, dev-only |
| Example: custom post-processing shader | Planned | |

**Exit criteria**: users can write and apply custom GLSL shaders to draw calls.

---

## Milestone 8 — Advanced 2D Features (Planned)

Goal: remaining Ebitengine 2D feature parity.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Off-screen render targets (`NewImage` as target) | Planned | Already in backend types |

| Multiple windows (stretch goal) | Planned | |
| Context loss recovery (mobile/web) | Planned | Godot-inspired command replay |
| `FUTURE_RENDER_BACKEND` env var selection | Planned | |

**Exit criteria**: all Ebitengine 2D examples can be ported with minimal
changes (import path swap + minor API adjustments).

## Principles

These guide every milestone:

1. **Additive, not rewrite** — new features add passes/types, never restructure
   existing working code.
2. **Tests before merge** — every milestone must pass `go test ./...` and
   `go vet ./...`.
3. **No CGo in core** — math, batch, pipeline, input remain pure Go. CGo is
   confined to `internal/backend/` and `internal/platform/` implementations.
4. **Ebitengine API compatibility** — public API names and signatures match
   Ebitengine where possible, enabling straightforward migration.
5. **3D-ready from day one** — no 2D-only assumptions in internal layers. See
   FUTURE_3D.md for constraints.
6. **Manual texture management** — no automatic atlas. Users control GPU memory
   explicitly, with optional atlas utilities.

## How to Update This File

When completing a milestone task:
1. Change its status from `Planned` to `Done`
2. Add any relevant notes (caveats, deviations from plan)
3. If new tasks were discovered during implementation, add them to the
   appropriate milestone or create a new one
4. Commit the ROADMAP.md update alongside the implementation
